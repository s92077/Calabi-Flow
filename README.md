# Calabi-Flow
This project is based on the following papers:
* Zhang, Min, et al. "The unified discrete surface Ricci flow." Graphical Models 76.5 (2014): 321-339.
* Jin, Miao, et al. "Discrete surface Ricci flow." IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 14.5 (2008): 1030-1043.
* Zhao, H., Li, X., Ge, H., Lei, N., Zhang, M., Wang, X., & Gu, X. (2018). Conformal mesh parameterization using discrete Calabi flow. Computer Aided Geometric Design, 63, 96-108.
This project is developed for the final report of the module IAM5811.

Some of the code are part of the following projects:
* [universal-covering-space][UCS]
* [geometry-processing-package][GPP]
